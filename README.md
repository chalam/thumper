# Thumper - fast mass image thumbnail generator

Thumper is a scriptable, command-line tool to generate thumbnails of
large batches of images.  Compared to other tools, Thumper's distinct
advantage is to fully leverage multiple CPU cores; if run on a machine
with N available cores, it will run up to N times faster than on a
single-core, single-CPU machine.

Thumper was originally created for the [Advanced Python
Newsletter][apn], to demonstrate
Python's multiprocessing module.
